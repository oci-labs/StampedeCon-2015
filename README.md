# StampedeCon 2015

This is an RStudio project that includes the scripts used to create the
slides for the "Interactive Visualization in Human Time" presentation at
StampedeCon 2015.

Some additional scripts are included that were used as live demo scripts
during the presentation as well.

Some additional packages may need to be installed to run the scripts in
some cases.
